# MVVM-C-iOS
This project is to implement the MVVM-C (Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator) architecutre pattern in an iOS app.
The Coordinator pattern was introduced by [Soroush Khanlou](http://khanlou.com/) at the NSSpain conference in 2015. I use the following pieces to learn more about the Coordinator pattern:
