# MVVM-C-iOS
This project is to implement the MVVM-C (Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator) architecutre pattern in an iOS app.
I use the following pieces to learn more about the Coordinator pattern:
- ["Coordinator Tutorial for iOS: Getting Started" by Andrew Kharchyshyn](https://www.kodeco.com/158-coordinator-pattern-in-ios)
- ["How to use the coordinator pattern in iOS apps" by Paul Hudson](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/71/how-to-use-the-coordinator-pattern-in-ios-apps)
- ["Navigation in Swift" by John Sundell](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/articles/navigation-in-swift/)
